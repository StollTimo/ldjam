Hey Thanks for trying out this attempt at a L4D2 Survival 

You should be able to add the Shelter.bsp file to your local maps folder

eg. mine is

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\maps 

Then if you boot up L4D2 and have the console commands enabled through Steam you can then type

map Shelter survival

This will load the map in the survial mode.

First time doing this so let me know if you have any problems :) 

I don't know if you need the .nav files or .vmf file but they're there if the navmesh doesn't work properly
